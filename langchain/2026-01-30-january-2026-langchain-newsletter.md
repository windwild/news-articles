We’re kicking off 2026 with a fresh set of agent-building updates, improved experiment comparison, and new reads on observability and evaluation. Read on to see everything we’ve shipped this January.

# Product Updates

### LangSmith

🚀 **LangSmith Agent Builder is now GA**

Build agents with natural language. Describe what you want, and Agent Builder figures out the approach, including a detailed prompt, tool selection, subagents, and skills. [Try Agent Builder](https://smith.langchain.com/agents?skipOnboarding=true&ref=blog.langchain.com).

📊 Spot regressions and improvements at a glance with side-by-side LLM experiment comparisons. Filter by inputs, outputs, status, or metadata to zero in on what matters. [Learn more.](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/compare-experiment-results?ref=blog.langchain.com#how-to-compare-experiment-results)

🤖 Insights Agent automatically analyzes your traces to detect usage patterns, common agent behaviors and failure modes – and is [now available for self-hosted LangSmith customers.](https://changelog.langchain.com/announcements/langsmith-self-hosted-v0-13?ref=blog.langchain.com)

### Open Source

**LangChain JS v1.2.13** improves agent robustness with dynamic tools, recovery from hallucinated tool calls, and better streaming error signals. [Learn more.](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/releases?ref=blog.langchain.com)

Stream live progress from subagents and surface who’s doing what as messages are generated in `deepagents`. [Learn more.](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/streaming/overview?ref=blog.langchain.com#streaming-from-sub-agents)

# Speak the Lang

**Agent observability powers agent evaluation**

Traditional software treats tracing and testing as separate. With agents, they’re inseparable. Teams shipping reliable agents use a single workflow where production traces directly power their evaluations.

Why this matters:

🔹 Agent behavior only emerges at runtime—traces show what actually happened

🔹 Evaluating agents means checking trajectories, outputs, _and_ state, not just final answers

🔹 Production traces become living test cases that shape what you evaluate next

[Read more here](https://www.langchain.com/conceptual-guides/agent-observability-powers-agent-evaluation?ref=blog.langchain.com) on how traces become the foundation of an agent eval strategy.

**Agent Builder’s memory is a filesystem**

Agents doing repeated tasks need to remember, so we gave Agent Builder memory using standard Markdown and JSON files. Here’s how we built it and what we learned. [Read more](https://www.langchain.com/conceptual-guides/how-we-built-agent-builders-memory?ref=blog.langchain.com).

**New Agent Builder Academy Course**

Learn how to build agents with LangSmith Agent Builder. We’ll cover set up, building and improving your agent, and then dive into Triggers, Subagents, MCP, and Skills. [Learn more](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/quickstart-agent-builder/?ref=blog.langchain.com).
