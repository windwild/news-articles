_At Sequoia’s AI Ascent conference in March, I talked about three limitations for agents: planning, UX, and memory. Check out that talk_ [_here_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBBe1pk8hf4&ref=blog.langchain.com) _. Since UX for agents is such a wide-ranging topic, we’ve split our discussion of it into three posts. See the first blog post on_ [_chat UX_](https://blog.langchain.com/ux-for-agents-part-1-chat-2/) _and the second on_ [_ambient UX_](https://blog.langchain.com/ux-for-agents-part-2-ambient/) _. This is our third post on UX for agents, focused on spreadsheet, generative, and collaborative UI/UX._

This is my third post on agent UX, but I could probably dive into ten more — there is so much to explore as we all figure out the best ways to build and interact with agents. The UI/UX space for agents is one of the spaces I am most excited about and will be watching closely for innovation in the coming months.

In an attempt to wrap up the discussion on agent UI/UX, I’ll highlight three lesser-known UXs that have recently become more popular. Each of these could easily deserve its own blog post (which may happen down the line!).

## Spreadsheet UX

One UX paradigm I’ve seen a lot in the past ~2 months is a spreadsheet UX. I first saw this when [Matrices, an AI-native spreadsheet](https://x.com/dina_yrl/status/1753206294784418024?ref=blog.langchain.com), was launched earlier this year.

I loved seeing this. First and foremost, the spreadsheet UX a super intuitive and user friendly way to support batch workloads. Each cell becomes it own agent, going to off to research a particular thing. This batching allows users to scale up and interact with multiple agents simultaneously.

There are other benefits of this UX as well. The spreadsheet format is a very common UX familiar to most users, so it fits in well with existing workflows. This type of UX is **perfect** for data enrichment, a common LLM use case where each column can represent a different attribute to enrich.

Since then, I’ve seen this UX pop up in a few places ( [Clay](https://www.clay.com/?ref=blog.langchain.com) and [Otto](https://x.com/SullyOmarr/status/1803779798658859067?ref=blog.langchain.com) are two great examples of this).

## Generative UI

The concept of “generative UI” can mean a few different things.

One interpretation is a truly generative UI where the model generates the raw components to display. This is similar to applications like [WebSim](https://websim.ai/?ref=blog.langchain.com). Under the hood, the agent is largely writing raw HTML, allowing it to have **FULL** control over what is displayed. However, this approach allows for a lot of variability in the quality of the generated HTML, so the end result may look a bit wild or unpolished.

![](images/ux-for-agents-part-3-spreadsheet-generative-and-collaborative-ui_ux/img_002.png)

Another more constrained approach to generative UI involves programmatically mapping the LLM response to different pre-defined UI components. This is often done with tool calls. For instance, if an LLM calls a weather API, it then triggers the rendering of a weather map UI component. Since the components rendered are not truly **generated** (but more chosen), the resulting UI will be more polished, though less flexible in what it can generate.

You can learn more about generative UI in [our video series here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL_KuQgX9Oc&ref=blog.langchain.com).

## Collaborative UX

A lesser explored UX: what happens when agents and humans are working together? Think Google Docs, where you can collaborate with teammates on writing or editing documents - but instead, one of your collaborators is an agent.

The leading thinkers in the space in my mind are [Geoffrey Litt](https://x.com/geoffreylitt?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&ref=blog.langchain.com) and [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/?ref=blog.langchain.com), with their [Patchwork project](https://x.com/geoffreylitt/status/1784717440720507355?ref=blog.langchain.com) being a great example of human-agent collaboration.

![](images/ux-for-agents-part-3-spreadsheet-generative-and-collaborative-ui_ux/img_003.jpg)

How does collaborative UX compare to the previously discussed [ambient UX](https://blog.langchain.com/ux-for-agents-part-2-ambient/)? Our founding engineer Nuno highlights the key differences between the two:

The main difference between ambient and collaborative is concurrency:

- In a **collaborative UX**, you and the LLM often do work simultaneously, "feeding" off of each others work
- In an **ambient UX**, the LLM is continuously doing work in the background while you, the user, focus on something else entirely

These differences also translate into distinct requirements when building these applications:

- For **collaborative UX**, you may need to display granular pieces of work being done by the LLM. (This falls somewhere on the spectrum between individual tokens and larger, application-specific pieces of work like paragraphs in a text editor). A common requirement might be having an automated way to merge concurrent changes, similar to how Google Doc manages real-time collaboration.
- For **ambient UX**, you may need to summarize the work done by the LLM or highlight any changes. A common requirement might be to trigger a run from an event that happened in some other system, e.g. via a webhook.

## Why are we thinking about this?

LangChain is not known for being a UI/UX focused company. But we spend a _lot_ of time thinking about this. Why?

Our goal is to make it as easy as possible to build agentic applications. How humans interact with these applications **greatly** affects the type of infrastructure that we need to build.

For example - we recently launched [LangGraph Cloud](https://blog.langchain.com/langgraph-cloud/), our infrastructure for deploying agentic applications at scale. It features multiple streaming modes, support for [“double-texting”](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/concepts/api/?ref=blog.langchain.com#double-texting) use cases, and [async background runs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/concepts/api/?ref=blog.langchain.com#stateless-runs). All of these were directly influenced by UI/UX trends that we saw emerging.

If you are building an application with a novel or interesting UI/UX (e.g. non-streaming chat) we would _love_ to hear from you at [hello@langchain.dev](mailto:hello@langchain.dev)!
