Following our [launch of long-term memory support](https://blog.langchain.com/launching-long-term-memory-support-in-langgraph/), we're adding semantic search to LangGraph's BaseStore. Available today in the open source `PostgresStore` and `InMemoryStore`'s, in LangGraph studio, as well as in production in all LangGraph Platform deployments.

## Why semantic search?

While our base memory implementation provides document storage and filtering, many users requested primitives for more sophisticated retrieval of unstructured information. Simple filtering works when you keep things well-organized, but agents often need to find relevant information based on meaning, not just exact matches.

For example, an agent might need to:

- Recall user preferences and past interactions for personalized responses
- Learn from past mistakes by retrieving similar failed approaches
- Maintain consistent knowledge by recalling important facts learned in previous interactions

Semantic search addresses these challenges by matching on meaning rather than exact content, making agents more effective at using their stored knowledge.

## Implementation

The `BaseStore` 's `search` (and asynchronous `asearch` ) methods now support a natural language `query` term. If the store you are using has added support, documents will be scored and returned based on semantic similarity. Support has been added to both the `InMemoryStore` for development and `PostgresStore` for production. An example usage is below:

```python
def search_memory(state: State, *, store: BaseStore):
    results = store.search(
        ("user_123", "interactions"),
        query=state["messages"][-1].content,
        filter={"type": "conversation"},
        limit=3
    )
    return {
        "context": [\
            f"Previous interaction ({r.score:.2f} relevance):\n{r.value}"\
            for r in results\
        ]
    }
Example search node to lookup relevant memories.
```

Example node querying for related content

To use in the LangGraph Platform, you can configure your server to embed new items through a `store` configuration in your `langgraph.json` file:

```json
{
  "store": {
    "index": {
      "embed": "openai:text-embeddings-3-small",
      "dims": 1536,
      "fields": ["text", "summary"]
    }
  }
}
```

The main configuration options:

- `embed`: Embedding provider (e.g., "openai:text-embedding-3-small") or path to custom function ( [doc](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/semantic_search/?ref=blog.langchain.com#custom-embeddings)). `provider:model` support depends on LangChain to use.
- `dims`: Dimension size of the chosen embedding model (1536 for OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small)
- `fields`: List of fields to index. Use `["$"]` to index entire documents, or specify json paths like `["text", "summary", "messages[-1]"]`

If you're not a LangChain user, or if you want to define custom embedding logic, define your own function:

```python
async def aembed_texts(texts: list[str]) -> list[list[float]]:
    response = await client.embeddings.create(
        model="text-embedding-3-small",
        input=texts
    )
    return [e.embedding for e in response.data]
```

Then reference your function in the config:

```json
{
  "store": {
    "index": {
      "embed": "path/to/embedding_function.py:embed_texts",
      "dims": 1536
    }
  }
}
```

If you want to customize which fields to embed for a given item, or if you want to omit an item from being indexed, pass the `index` arg to `store.put`

```
# embed the configured default "text" field "Python tutorial"
store.put(("docs",), "doc1", {"text": "Python tutorial"})
# Override default field to embed "other_field" instead
store.put(
    ("docs",),
    "doc2",
    {"text": "TypeScript guide", "other_field": "value"},
    index=["other_field"],
)
# Do not embed this item
store.put(("docs",), "doc2", {"text": "Other guide"}, index=False)
```

See the [docs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/semantic_search/?ref=blog.langchain.com#custom-embeddings) for more information.

## Migration

If you're already using LangGraph's memory store, adding semantic search is non-breaking. All operations work the same as before. LangGraph OSS users can start using by constructing their `PostGresStore` with an index configuration ( [sync](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/store/?ref=blog.langchain.com#langgraph.store.postgres.PostgresStore) & [async](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/store/?ref=blog.langchain.com#langgraph.store.postgres.AsyncPostgresStore) docs):

```
from langchain.embeddings import init_embeddings
from langgraph.store.postgres import PostgresStore

store = PostgresStore(
    connection_string="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname",
    index={
        "dims": 1536,
        "embed": init_embeddings("openai:text-embedding-3-small"),
        # specify which fields to embed. Default is the whole serialized value
        "fields": ["text"],
    },
)
store.setup()  # Do this once to run migrations
```

For LangGraph platform users, once you add an `index` configuration to your deployment, new documents that are `put` into the store can be indexed for search, and you can add a natural language `query` string to return documents sorted by semantic similarity.
