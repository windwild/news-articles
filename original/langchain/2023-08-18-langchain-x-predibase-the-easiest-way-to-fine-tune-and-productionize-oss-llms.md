_Editor's Note: This post was written in collaboration with the Predibase team. We're really excited about the way their integration with LangChain helps bring production-grade standards and workflows to open-source to open-source models._

Today, we’re announcing a Langchain Integration for [Predibase](https://predibase.com/?ref=blog.langchain.com). This integration allows Langchain developers to seamlessly integrate hosted OSS models on Predibase into their workflows.

## What is Predibase?

Predibase is a Developer platform for OSS LLMs. Predibase allows builders to:

- Deploy and query pre-trained or custom open source LLMs without the hassle
- Operationalize an end-to-end Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system
- Fine-tune their own LLM in just a few lines of code

If using commercial LLM providers like OpenAI / Anthropic / Cohere might not be a good fit due to privacy or cost, Predibase might be a natural choice to explore. While Predibase is focused on helping you productionize open-source LLMs, the platform itself is also built on top of open-source foundations including Ludwig and Horovod. It supports multiple interfaces including a UI and a Python SDK, making it accessible to users of all levels. Best of all, the platform can be deployed on Predibase-managed infrastructure or securely inside your own Cloud VPC so your data and models stay within your secure environment.

## Langchain + Predibase

Setup:

1. Sign up for Predibase for free: [https://predibase.com/free-trial](https://predibase.com/free-trial?ref=blog.langchain.com)
2. Create an Account
3. Go to Settings > My profile and Generate a new API Token

### Q/A Example ( [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ASRX6BOVMfgAEkTmcCDYATCSbfzfg3S4?usp=sharing&ref=blog.langchain.com))

Below is an example of a simple Q/A system you can build using Langchain and Predibase-hosted LLMs.

```
pip install predibase
pip install langchain
pip install chromadb
pip install sentence_transformers

# Replace with your Predibase API Token
import os
os.environ[“PREDIBASE_API_TOKEN”] = “{PREDIBASE_API_TOKEN}”

from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator
from langchain.llms import Predibase

# Document loader
from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
loader = WebBaseLoader("https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/")
data = loader.load()

# Split into Chunks
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size = 500, chunk_overlap = 0)
all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data)

# Store Embeddings in Chroma
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits,embedding = HuggingFaceEmbeddings())

# Pull in any LLM from Predibase, including fine-tuned LLM’s
llm = Predibase(model="llama-2-13b", predibase_api_key=os.environ.get("PREDIBASE_API_TOKEN"))

# Fetch relevant chunks into LLM
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm,retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever())
qa_chain({"query": question})
```

We’re very excited to make these capabilities available for all LangChain users and we couldn’t be more excited to see what the community builds!
