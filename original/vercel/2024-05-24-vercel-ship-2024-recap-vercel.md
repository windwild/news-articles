This year we introduced some powerful features to enhance iteration velocity:

- Improved platform and Next.js **integrations for feature flags**

- Log, block, and challenge malicious traffic with the **Vercel Firewall**

- New tools to improve iteration velocity in the **Vercel Toolbar**

- React 19 support, improved caching, and more in the **Next.js 15 Release Candidate**

## Working with feature flags on Vercel

Flags are now integrated into Vercel Web Analytics and logs. You can look at your site's page views or custom analytics events based on which feature flags were active, helping you better understand how your flags impact your users.

Plus, you can now try our new experimental design pattern for working with flags in Next.js (and soon SvelteKit). It encodes our best practices to help avoid the challenges of client-side experimentation and makes server-side experimentation much more approachable.

## Introducing Vercel Firewall

![The new Vercel Firewall.](images/vercel-ship-2024-recap-vercel/img_003.jpg)![The new Vercel Firewall.](images/vercel-ship-2024-recap-vercel/img_004.jpg)The new Vercel Firewall.

Vercel Firewall allows you to create custom rules to log, block, challenge, or rate limit (beta) traffic. This application-aware firewall combines performance with simplified management:

- Rules can be based on 15+ fields, including request path, user agent, IP address, JA4 fingerprint, geolocation, HTTP headers, and even target path

- Firewall configuration changes propagate within 300ms globally. If you make a mistake, you can instantly rollback to previous rules


[**Be secure by default.**\\
\\
Take your application security to the next level with Vercel Firewall, offering robust protection against a wide range of web threats.\\

## v0

v0 helps you [go from idea to UI in seconds](https://v0.dev/), enabling you to generate React code from simple text prompts and images. We've made v0 even faster, more reliable, and more accessible by enhancing platform reliability and automatically adding ARIA attributes to generated code.

## AI SDK

The Vercel AI SDK is a TypeScript library for building AI-powered applications with React, Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, and more. The SDK is organized into three pillars:

- [AI SDK Core](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-core): A unified API to work with leading LLMs from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and Groq

- [AI SDK UI](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-ui): For building streaming chatbots with minimal code

- [AI SDK RSC](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-rsc): Dynamic, component-based "Generative UI" experiences powered by AI


With the Vercel AI SDK, developers can easily build the intelligent web applications of the future.
