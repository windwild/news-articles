The Runtime Logs search bar in your project dashboard has been redesigned to make filtering and exploring your logs faster and more intuitive.

- **Structured filters.** When you type a filter like `level:error` or `status:500`, the search bar parses it into a visual pill you can read at a glance and remove with a click. Complex queries with multiple filters become easy to scan and edit without retyping anything

- **Smarter suggestions.** As you type, the search bar suggests filter values based on your actual log data. Recent queries are saved per-project and appear at the top, so you can rerun common searches without retyping them

- **Better input handling.** The search bar validates your filters as you type and flags errors with a tooltip so you can fix typos before running a search. Pasting a Vercel Request ID automatically converts it into a filter


These improvements are available now in your project dashboard. Learn more about [runtime logs](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/runtime-logs).
