Aug 27, 2025

We've published [`@vercel/slack-bolt`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/slack-bolt), our official adapter for deploying Slack's [Bolt for JavaScript](https://docs.slack.dev/tools/bolt-js/) to Vercel's AI Cloud.

Bolt provides a type-safe library for responding to Slack webhook events. However, Slack's API requires a response within three seconds or users are faced with timeouts. This has made it hard to build Slack agents on traditional serverless platforms.

Our adapter uses [Fluid compute’s](https://vercel.com/fluid) streaming and `waitUntil` to acknowledge responses within Slack’s deadline while your agent continues working in the background.

api/slack/events.ts

```javascript
import { App } from "@slack/bolt";

import { generateText } from "ai";

import { VercelReceiver, createHandler } from "@vercel/slack-bolt";



const receiver = new VercelReceiver();



const app = new App({

8  token: process.env.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN,

9  signingSecret: process.env.SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET,

10  receiver,

11  deferInitialization: true,

12});



14// listening to Slack messages

app.event("message", async ({ say, message }) => {

16  const { text } = await generateText({

17    model: "openai/gpt-5",

18    prompt: `Respond to the user's message: ${message.text}`,

19  });

20  // responding to Slack

21  await say(text);

22});



export const POST = createHandler(app, receiver);
```

Listen to Slack messages and respond using the AI SDK

This adapter works with any function or framework using the Web API Request object such as Hono, Nitro or Next.js.
