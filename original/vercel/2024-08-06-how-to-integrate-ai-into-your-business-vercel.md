## Building a robust AI use case

Before jumping headlong into AI development, it's crucial to identify and evaluate AI use cases that align with your business goals and technical capabilities.

### Identifying target use cases

When considering potential AI applications, look for areas where a frontend-centric approach can deliver rapid results and tangible value.

Traditional AI use cases are valuable, but the real opportunity lies in pushing the boundaries to create exceptional customer value.

Consider these innovative AI applications that transform user interactions:

- Personalized user journeys

- Real-time [generative UI](https://vercel.com/blog/ai-sdk-3-generative-ui)

- [Intelligent search](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/noahfreeman_googlecloud-ugcPost-7222639802423128064-fTzF) and recommendation systems

- Advanced conversational shopping assistants

- Natural language interfaces

- Predictive analytics for user behavior

- Custom 3D product design generators


These AI-driven features go beyond simple automation, reimagining how users interact with your products or services. They create more engaging, efficient, and personalized experiences that significantly enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. The most impactful AI use cases often unlock new creative possibilities, opening up a new world for customer experience.

In today's AI landscape, where language models have become commoditized, the true differentiator lies in frontend development and user experience. Vercel's platform enables developers to create intuitive, AI-powered interfaces that set applications apart. This frontend-focused approach ensures that AI is seamlessly integrated into a superior user experience.​

### **Evaluating AI use cases**

To systematically assess potential AI features, we've developed the Vercel Impact Assessment for AI Initiatives (VIA-AI). This framework helps you prioritize AI projects based on their potential impact and feasibility within the Vercel ecosystem.

**Vercel Impact Assessment for AI Initiatives (VIA-AI)**

1. **Value potential:** Assesses the expected return on investment (ROI) and overall impact of the AI initiative. This includes improvements to customer experience, operational efficiency, revenue generation, or cost reduction. Consider both short-term gains and long-term strategic value. _(1 = Minimal value, 5 = Transformative impact)_

2. **Integration feasibility:** Evaluates how easily the AI solution can be implemented within your existing technology stack and processes. This covers technical compatibility, required resources, and the level of disruption to current workflows. Consider the availability of necessary skills and the learning curve for your team. _(1 = Highly complex integration, 5 = Seamless integration)_

3. **Strategic alignment:** Measures how well the AI use case aligns with your organization's overall strategy and objectives. This pillar ensures that the AI initiative contributes directly to your core business aims rather than being a standalone or tangential project. _(1 = Minimal alignment, 5 = Perfect strategic fit)_

4. **Business logic enhancement:** Assesses how significantly the AI will improve or augment existing business processes and decision-making. This includes the potential for automation of routine tasks, enhancement of human capabilities, and the introduction of new, AI-driven insights that can inform strategy and operations. _(1 = Minor enhancements, 5 = Major process improvements)_

5. **Data quality and availability:** Evaluates the readiness, accessibility, and quality of data required for the AI initiative. This includes assessing data completeness, accuracy, relevance, and ease of accessing and processing the necessary data. _(1 = Poor data quality or significant data gaps, 5 = High-quality, comprehensive data readily available)_

6. **Performance and scalability:** Examines the AI solution's ability to handle increased loads, adapt to growing data volumes, and maintain responsiveness as the user base expands. Also considers the solution's performance in terms of speed, reliability, and resource efficiency across various operating conditions. _(1 = Performance concerns and limited scalability, 5 = Excellent performance characteristics and highly scalable)_

7. **Security, compliance, and user trust:** Examines the AI solution's adherence to data protection standards, regulatory requirements, and principles that foster user confidence in the system. This pillar assesses the robustness of security measures, compliance with relevant regulations, and the ability to build and maintain user trust through responsible AI practices. _(1 = Significant security and compliance risks, low user trust, 5 = Robust security, full compliance, high user trust potential)_


_If your average score is above 4, it’s almost certainly time to begin implementing your imagined AI feature. Below 3, and you may need to take some time to reevaluate the lacking pillars._

When applying this framework, involve stakeholders from various departments to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. This collaborative approach helps build internal support and alignment for your AI initiatives.

### ) Developing key performance indicators (KPIs)

Once you've identified promising AI use cases, it's essential to establish clear, measurable KPIs. These should encompass both technical performance and business outcomes.

| **Technical KPIs** | **Related Business KPIs** |
| --- | --- |
| Model Accuracy | Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Score |
| Response Time | Conversion Rate |
| Uptime / Availability | Customer Retention Rate |
| Error Rate | Brand Sentiment |
| Throughput (queries per second) | Operational Efficiency |
| Latency | Time-to-Market for New Features |
| Data Quality Score | Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) |
| Model Drift Rate | Upsell/Cross-sell Success Rate |
| Resource Utilization | Cost Reduction |
| API Call Success Rate | Employee Productivity |
| Security Incident Rate | Regulatory Compliance Score |
| Data Processing Speed | Revenue Growth |
| Model Training Time | Return on Investment (ROI) |
| A/B Test Performance | Net Promoter Score (NPS) |
| User Adoption Rate | Market Share |

When setting KPIs, establish baseline metrics before implementing AI to accurately measure impact. Use [Vercel's observability suite](https://vercel.com/docs/observability) to track performance in real-time.
