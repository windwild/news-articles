Learn prompt engineering best practices for working with v0's core functionality to get the best results.

[v0](https://v0.dev/) is a powerful tool for generating high-quality UIs and code, and it's also an educational asset for designing and creating on the web. It leverages deep integrations with libraries and modern frameworks like Next.js and React. Whether you're looking to scaffold a new project, fetch data, or create [3D graphics](https://vercel.com/blog/add-3d-to-your-web-projects-with-v0-and-react-three-fiber), v0 is designed to meet all your frontend development needs.

To get the highest quality generations, you need to be able to craft input prompts to guide v0 well. The better you guide v0 and understand its strengths, the more accurate and relevant the responses you'll get.

In this post, we’ll look at how you can get the most out of v0’s core features, UI generation abilities, code generation, and developer support.

## Writing the right prompt

The more details you write, the better v0 can tailor its response to your needs:

- Include desired functionality of specific components

- Specify design preferences for every element

- Mention any libraries or frameworks you want to use

- Describe the context or use case for the component within the app you're working on


Don't hesitate to ask for modifications or improvements to the generated code or UI:

- Request specific changes or enhancements

- Ask for alternative implementations or generations

- Seek explanations for parts of the code you don't understand

- Use v0's suggestions to refine your ideas


## Understanding where v0 excels

v0's comprehensive chat interface guides users through building, debugging, and shipping web applications. While it's always learning and improving, it's helpful to know where v0 excels.

## UI generation

One of the standout features of v0 is its ability to generate high-quality React UIs using [shadcn/ui](https://shadcn.dev/) components. But that’s just the beginning—v0 has top support for integrating with a wide range of third-party libraries to make your UI creations dynamic and versatile. v0 can also use component libraries from npm like [Material UI](https://v0.dev/chat/FXQl5UbGZfY?b=b_qfx2WLwvGKC&f=0).

[`"Create a SaaS pricing table but use Material UI React components where possible."`](https://v0.dev/chat/FXQl5UbGZfY?b=b_qfx2WLwvGKC&f=0)

## Third-party library support

While v0 can technically use any library, it performs best with certain well-documented libraries, including:

- [`react-three-fiber`](https://v0.dev/chat/BQeR6T-fQMw?b=b_0CmKQnWF2Wj) for 3D graphics

- [`framer-motion`](https://v0.dev/chat/IrfSVKGnJ4L?b=b_XwIWdqgeSZx) for component animations

- [`lodash`](https://v0.dev/chat/KFnEFNA2nRX?b=b_eC5xghO8dHR) for utility functions

- [`react-confetti`](https://v0.dev/chat/xGUswrr2591?b=b_PNjJiy1B9as) for interactive elements

- [`react-flow`](https://v0.dev/chat/NmXMnPW8d4V?b=b_riaFZRNoh98) for flow diagrams

- [`react-bootstrap`](https://v0.dev/chat/xsDK2MMRfeX) for UI foundations


If you're using a more obscure library, you may need to provide some guidance. For the most part, v0 handles incorporating npm packages in your code generations quite well. You can guide v0 by chatting in natural language or by sharing data and documentation in your Projects by adding files as a Source.

You can add PDFs, TXT files, code files, and other documentation as Sources for your Projects to learn from, giving you tailored generations.

## Fetching data from external sources

v0 can fetch data from external APIs, though you should be cautious about sharing sensitive information like API secrets. For instance, if a secret is sent through a message and used in production, it will store the secret client-side—creating a security vulnerability. This is best avoided for production applications.

Additionally, v0 can help you not only write the actual ISR code to fetch to your CMS, but can also help you come up with the technical integration strategy with your backend (AWS, AEM, Salesforce, etc.).

## Fonts and styling

You can enable custom fonts in v0 by telling it to “import X font from Google Fonts”. Furthermore, you can tell v0 to adjust CSS properties to fine-tune the design, ensuring it matches your aesthetic vision.

If your initial designs don’t look right, ask v0 to change specific visual properties.

`“Make the background color black, round the corners of elements, apply a light white border to the card components, and make all the buttons ghost.”`

Using a tool like [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) can also help generate cohesive color palettes to theme your UI generations effectively.

## 3D graphics

v0 is great at generating 3D graphics, particularly with `react-three-fiber`. If v0 indicates that it can’t generate in 3D, simply append “using react-three-fiber” to your query for better results. This functionality to great for designers who don’t want to code or spend hours wiring up 3D elements in traditional design tools.

## Integration with Next.js

Not only can v0 generate UIs, but it can also install them directly into an existing [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project via the CLI. You can even scaffold an entirely new Next.js project if you’re starting from scratch.

## Technical planning

v0 can provide technical planning support, to help support the ideation phase of engineering projects. For example v0 can generate [migration plans](https://v0.dev/chat/BTYi63JuTtK), helping teams transition from monolithic architectures or different frameworks. It can also generate intricate [architecture diagrams](https://v0.dev/chat/ZxW6VCFxY0K?b=b_glnozjN13An) that visualize complex systems, making it easier for teams to understand and refine their designs.

## Frontend development support

When it comes to code generation, v0 is able to create advanced React and Next.js features. Alongside the code generations, v0 excels at breaking down complex frontend tasks into manageable steps. Whether it’s creating RSCs or working with new React and Next.js features, v0 provides thorough explanations to guide you through the process.

It also supports frameworks like [Svelte](https://v0.dev/chat/JJL6vKmYPPt?b=b_90A1TbvZTOa), Vue, and Remix, though with slightly less confidence compared to its expertise in React and Next.js.

Moreover, it supports code generation for other programming languages like Python and Rust, as well as writing SQL queries. While it is more proficient with JavaScript, it still offers step-by-step breakdowns for development tasks in these languages.

If you need to execute simple JavaScript snippets, v0’s Code Execution Block allows you to test code directly within the chat interface.
