AI platforms, coding tools, and workflow apps can now create projects on Vercel that users can later claim as their own, transferring deployment ownership together with any resources by third-party providers.

How it works:

1. Instant deployment: Any third-party can use the [Vercel API](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/reference/endpoints/integrations/connect-integration-resource-to-project) to create a project, deploy an application, and attach a resource store (such as a database).

2. Claim and transfer: When a user claims the Vercel deployment, the attached resources automatically move with it. Full ownership of the complete deployment is handed off to the user.


This is available today through [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/blog/introducing-instant-app-deployments-in-partnership-with-vercel), the first Vercel Marketplace provider to support instant deployment. Prisma customers can now spin up a database and a Vercel-hosted app together as a single, bundled stack.

We’re expanding this flow to more Marketplace providers so they can pair their products, such as authentication, observability, and workflow services, with Vercel deployments through one-click claiming.
