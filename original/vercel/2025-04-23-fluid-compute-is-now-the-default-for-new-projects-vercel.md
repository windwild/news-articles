New Vercel projects now run on [Fluid compute](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-fluid-compute) by default.

This update follows [Fluid’s general availability](https://vercel.com/changelog/vercel-functions-can-now-run-on-fluid-compute), its adoption across large-scale production apps, and all [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/) deployments [shipping with Fluid enabled](https://x.com/v0/status/1910732097792467373) by default.

Fluid compute reuses existing instances before spawning new ones, cutting costs by up to 85% for high-concurrency workloads. It combines the efficiency of servers with the flexibility of serverless:

- Concurrent requests per function

- Scale from zero to infinity

- Minimal cold starts

- Usage-based, pay as you go

- Full Node.js and Python support

- No infrastructure to manage

- Background tasks with `waitUntil`


[Enable Fluid](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fsettings%2Ffunctions%23fluid-compute&title=Go+to+Function+Settings) for your existing projects, and learn more in our [blog](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-fluid-compute) and [documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/fluid-compute).
