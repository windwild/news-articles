We recently [introduced bytecode caching](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-bytecode-caching-for-vercel-functions)—an experimental feature built on our new Rust-based core for Vercel Functions—designed to drastically reduce start times during [increasingly rare](https://vercel.com/changelog/vercel-functions-now-have-faster-and-fewer-cold-starts) cold starts. Even when cold starts do occur, their impact is now minimal and barely noticeable.

After validating the stability and performance improvements of bytecode caching, the feature is now **stable and the default** for all [Node.js 20+ Vercel Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/node-js#using-the-node.js-runtime-with-serverless-functions).

This change **reduces global cold start times by up to 60%,** exceeding our initial benchmarks and observations. The improvement is particularly significant for functions that load a large amount of JavaScript, with smaller functions experiencing less impact.

Bytecode caching is automatically enabled for all functions running on [Node.js 20 and using CommonJS](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/node-js#bytecode-caching) (e.g., Next.js). Additionally, we're working to extend this support to include ESM for broader compatibility. Learn more in [our blog post](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-bytecode-caching-for-vercel-functions).
