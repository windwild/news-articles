## Deployments

- Next.js Deployments created via Git don't render debug logs anymore.

- The "Functions" tab available on every deployment now shows the requests of all Serverless Functions by default.

- Node.js 8 has reached [end-of-life](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/). New deployments using Node.js 8.10.x will print a warning in the deployment logs today and will fail to build starting **2020-01-06**.


## Domains

- Shortened domain's TXT verification records to 10 characters.

- Domain Redirects now work on Internet Explorer.

- A suggestion is now being rendered if you're using the `alias` property in `now.json` instead of configuring them on the "Domains" tab on the dashboard.

- Purchasing domains now allows for adding a credit card directly in the purchasing flow, instead of having to switch to a separate page.

- Clicking "Buy" on the dashboard's "Domains" tab now retains the active team.

- After purchasing a Domain, you will now be taken to the "Domains" tab on the dashboard, instead of the documentation.

- Just like on the "Domains" tab on the dashboard, the `alias` property in `now.json` can now contain up to 50 Domains.

- Wildcard Domains are now being excluded from the "Redirect to" Domain feature.


## Dashboard

- Logs can now render visual ASCII layouts.

- The "Deployment Duration" shown for every deployment now doesn't include the duration for which your deployment was queued anymore.

- Team slugs are now automatically lowercased, when entered with uppercase characters.

- Updated fieldset footer to clarify that we support YouTube and Image links for Integration feature media.

- Interested partners on [/partners](https://vercel.com/partners) are now able to out via the [partnership@vercel.com](mailto:partnership@vercel.com) email address.
