You can now access Z.ai's latest model, GLM-4.7, with Vercel's [AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/ai-gateway) and no other provider accounts required.

GLM-4.7 comes with major improvements in coding, tool usage, and multi-step reasoning, especially with complex agentic tasks. The model also has a more natural tone for a better conversational experience and can product a more refined aesthetic for front-end work.

To start building with GLM-4.7 via [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/), set the model to `zai/glm-4.7`:

```tsx
import { streamText } from 'ai';



const result = streamText({

4  model: 'zai/glm-4.7',

5  prompt:

6    `Create an interactive weather timeline app, fetch forecasts

7     via weather tool, normalize data, render animated charts,

8     cache results, and produce a production build.`

9});
```

AI Gateway provides a unified API for calling models, tracking usage and cost, and configuring retries, failover, and performance optimizations for higher-than-provider uptime. It includes built-in [observability](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/observability), [Bring Your Own Key support](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/byok), and intelligent [provider routing](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/provider-options) with automatic retries.
