Oct 8, 2025

You can now programmatically search, price, buy, renew, and transfer domains with Vercel’s new [Domains Registrar API](https://vercel.com/docs/domains/registrar-api), complementing the new in-product [Domains experience](https://vercel.com/changelog/vercel-domains-at-cost-pricing-and-the-fastest-on-the-web).

The API provides endpoints for:

- **Catalog & pricing:** list supported TLDs; get TLD and per-domain pricing.

- **Availability:** check single or bulk availability.

- **Orders & purchases:** buy domains (including bulk) and fetch order status by ID.

- **Transfers:** retrieve auth codes, transfer in, and track transfer status.

- **Management:** renew, toggle auto-renewal, update nameservers, and fetch TLD-specific contact schemas.


The [Legacy Domains API](https://vercel.com/docs/domains/registrar-api#deprecations-and-migration) is now deprecated. If you use the Vercel CLI for domain purchases, pricing, or availability, upgrade to **v48.2.8**. Sunset date: **2025-11-09**.
