You can now access xAI's latest models, Grok 4.1 Fast Reasoning and Grok 4.1 Fast Non-Reasoning, via Vercel's [AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/ai-gateway) with no other provider accounts required. These models have a 2M context window and are designed for agentic tool calling.

Grok 4.1 Fast Reasoning is best suited for structured reasoning and agentic operations that require high accuracy, whereas Grok 4.1 Fast Non-Reasoning is tailored to speed.

To use the Grok 4.1 Fast models in AI Gateway with the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/), set `model` to `xai/grok-4.1-fast-reasoning` or `xai/grok-4.1-fast-non-reasoning`.

```tsx
import { streamText } from 'ai';



const result = streamText({

4  model: 'xai/grok-4.1-fast-reasoning',

5  prompt:

6  `Take the uploaded report and extract the most relevant financial trends.

7   Note any outliers and provide a detailed  analysis with citations.`,

8});
```

AI Gateway provides a unified API for calling models, tracking usage and cost, and configuring retries, failover, and performance optimizations for higher-than-provider uptime. It includes built-in [observability](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/observability), [Bring Your Own Key support](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/byok), and intelligent [provider routing](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/provider-options) with automatic retries.
