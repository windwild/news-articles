Nov 4, 2025

We're announcing an integration with [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) for [v0](https://v0.app/). With this, you can connect v0 to Snowflake, ask questions about your data, and build data-driven [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) applications that deploy directly to Snowflake.

The application and authentication are managed through Vercel's secure vibe coding architecture, while compute runs on Snowflake's secure and governed platform, ensuring that your data never leaves your Snowflake environment.

[Sign up for the waitlist](https://vercel.com/go/v0-snowflake-waitlist) to get notified when it's ready for testing.

## What you can do with the v0 Snowflake integration

This integration works similarly to other v0 integrations. Start a chat about your Snowflake data, and v0 will prompt you to authenticate via OAuth, connecting your chat to your Snowflake account. v0 accesses your data based on your Snowflake permissions, so users only see what they're authorized to access. Once connected, v0 can query your data to understand what databases, tables, and AI models you have available.

### Ask questions about your data

Chat with v0 about your schema and run queries in natural language. Ask v0 to show you what tables exist in a database, describe the structure of your data, or explore what you have with simple queries. This works conversationally, so you can refine your questions as you go.

### Build applications that query your data

v0 generates complete Next.js applications that query your Snowflake data along with semantic context. Describe what you want, and v0 builds it, including API routes that run server-side, not just client-side React components. You can build auto-updating dashboards, data visualization tools, or custom internal applications, then iterate on the design and functionality.

### Deploy to Snowflake

When you're ready to deploy, click Deploy, and your application is deployed to Snowflake. The compute runs inside your Snowflake account while the application and authentication layers are managed through Vercel's secure vibe coding architecture.

## Use cases for building with v0 and Snowflake

This integration enables anyone to create AI applications, not just developers. Teams can build the tools they need without waiting for engineering resources.

**Sales pipeline dashboard**: Build a real-time dashboard that shows current pipeline status, conversion rates, and deal velocity. The dashboard queries your CRM data and updates automatically, so sales leaders can see current numbers without requesting custom reports.

**Inventory monitoring tool**: Create an application that tracks inventory levels across warehouses and flags items that need reordering. The app queries your supply chain tables and sends alerts when stock falls below thresholds.

**Customer analytics application**: Generate a tool that analyzes customer behavior patterns, cohort retention, and product usage. Product teams can explore customer data without waiting for engineering resources.

**Financial reporting interface**: Build custom reporting tools that pull from your financial data tables. Finance teams can create the exact reports they need, filtered and formatted how they want, without learning SQL.

## Vercel’s secure vibe coding architecture keeps your data safe

The integration uses a split architecture. When you deploy an application built with v0, the application and authentication layer run on Vercel's infrastructure, while compute runs inside your Snowflake account. Data never leaves Snowflake, and data is not copied, moved, or exported.

This solves two major problems with vibe-coded applications. First, you don't need to manually configure authentication or worry about whether security is set up correctly. Vercel's access management layer handles authentication automatically. Second, apps built with v0 automatically follow the same access policies you've already set in Snowflake. If someone shouldn't have access to certain tables or data, they won't be able to access it through the application either. No risk of vibe-coded apps exposing unauthorized data or getting into the wrong hands.

The application inherits your existing Snowflake security controls, authentication, and access policies, which means no separate security review for data access and no additional infrastructure to govern. Applications meet your enterprise security requirements by default because compute operates entirely within your existing Snowflake deployment, while the application layer benefits from Vercel's secure vibe coding architecture.
