Bulk aliasing for multi-tenant applications now runs significantly faster, reducing total aliasing time by up to **95%**.

Multi-tenant applications on Vercel let a single project serve many customers behind the scenes. These applications are often fronted by hundreds or thousands of domains. Previously, aliasing—the process of pointing a domain to a different deployment—was a slow process that added significant overhead to deployments.

This optimization is now live for all customers and has led to dramatic improvements, like:

- **App with 13,254 domains:** ~10min → 28 seconds

- **App with 23,743 domains:** 8min 37secs → 26 seconds
