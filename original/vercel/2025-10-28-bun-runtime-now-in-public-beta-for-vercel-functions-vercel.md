The Bun runtime is now available in Public Beta for Vercel Functions.

You can choose between Node.js and Bun as your project runtime, selecting the best option for your workload.

[Benchmarks show Bun reduced average latency by 28%](https://vercel.com/blog/bun-runtime-on-vercel-functions#benchmark-results) for CPU-bound Next.js rendering compared to Node.js.

To use Bun in Vercel Functions, set the runtime globally in your project's `vercel.json`:

vercel.json

```json
1{

2  "bunVersion": "1.x"

3}
```

Enable Bun runtime support in your app by adding bunVersion to vercel.json

We currently support the following frameworks, with more on the way:

- `Next.js`

- `Hono`

- `Express`

- `Nitro`


Bun supports TypeScript with zero configuration. Here's an example with Hono:

src/index.ts

```typescript
import { Hono } from 'hono';



const app = new Hono();



app.get('/', (c) => {

6  return c.text(`Hello from Hono on Bun ${process.versions.bun}!`);

7});



export default app;
```

Hello World endpoint in Hono with the Bun runtime on Vercel

Or get started with one of our starter templates:

- [Express on Bun](https://vercel.com/templates/backend/express-on-bun)

- [Hono on Bun](https://vercel.com/templates/backend/hono-on-bun)


Bun deployments automatically integrate with Vercel's existing logging, observability, and monitoring systems.
