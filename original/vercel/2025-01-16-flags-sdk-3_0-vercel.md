The [Flags SDK](https://flags-sdk.dev/) is a library that gives developers tools to use feature flags in Next.js and SvelteKit applications.

The Flags SDK version 3.0 adds:

- Pages Router support so feature flags can be used in App Router and Pages Router

- New adapters architecture that allows the SDK to integrate with various data sources and feature flag providers

- A new `identify` concept that allows you to establish an evaluation context for your feature flags. With this addition, you can tailor flags and experiments for individual users or groups


```tsx
import { flag } from 'flags/next';



export const exampleFlag = flag({

4  key: 'example-flag',

5  decide() {

6    return false;

7  },

8});
```
