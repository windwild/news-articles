The default limits for Vercel Functions using [Fluid compute](https://vercel.com/fluid) have increased, with longer execution times, more memory, and more CPU.

The default execution time, for all projects on all plans, is now 300 seconds (5 minutes):

| Plan | Default | Maximum |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hobby | 300s (previously 60s) | 300s (previously 60s) |
| Pro | 300s (previously 90s) | 800s |
| Enterprise | 300s (previously 90s) | 800s |

Memory and CPU instance sizes have also been updated:

- **Standard** (default) is now 1 vCPU / 2 GB (previously 1 vCPU / 1.7 GB)

- **Performance** is now 2 vCPU / 4 GB (previously 1.7 vCPU / 3 GB)


The Basic CPU instance has been removed. Hobby projects now use Standard CPU.

These increased instances are enabled by [Active CPU pricing](https://vercel.com/changelog/lower-pricing-with-active-cpu-pricing-for-fluid-compute), which charges based on actual compute time. Periods of memory-only usage are billed at a significantly lower rate, making longer executions more cost-efficient.

You can view logs to determine if your functions are hitting execution limits and adjust the max duration or upgrade your plan as needed.
