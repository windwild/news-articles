You can now access [Kimi K2](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-K2), a new mixture-of-experts (MoE) language model from [Moonshot AI](https://www.moonshot.ai/), using Vercel's [AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway) with no other provider accounts required.

AI Gateway lets you call the model with a consistent unified API and just a single string update, track usage and cost, and configure performance optimizations, retries, and failover for higher than provider-average uptime.

To use it with the [AI SDK v5](https://v5.ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction), start by installing the package:

```bash
pnpm i ai
```

Then set the model to `moonshotai/kimi-k2`:

```tsx
import { streamText } from 'ai'



const result = streamText({

4  model: 'moonshotai/kimi-k2',

5  prompt: 'What is the history of the San Francisco Mission-style burrito?'

6})
```

Includes built-in [observability](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/observability), [Bring Your Own Key support](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway#configuring-your-own-provider-keys-byok), and intelligent [provider routing](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/provider-options) with automatic retries.

To deliver high performance and reliability to Kimi K2, AI Gateway leverages multiple model providers under the hood, including direct to Moonshot AI, Groq, DeepInfra, Fireworks AI, and Parasail.
