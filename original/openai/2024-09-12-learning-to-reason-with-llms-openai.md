# Learning to reason with LLMs

[Contributions](https://openai.com/openai-o1-contributions/) [Use o1(opens in a new window)](https://chatgpt.com/?openaicom-did=6fb0984e-74f3-453d-8921-0226705c79c2&openaicom_referred=true)



OpenAI o1 ranks in the 89th percentile on competitive programming questions (Codeforces), places among the top 500 students in the US in a qualifier for the USA Math Olympiad (AIME), and exceeds human PhD-level accuracy on a benchmark of physics, biology, and chemistry problems (GPQA). While the work needed to make this new model as easy to use as current models is still ongoing, we are releasing an early version of this model, OpenAI o1‑preview, for immediate use in ChatGPT and to [trusted API users⁠(opens in a new window)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/usage-tiers).

Our large-scale reinforcement learning algorithm teaches the model how to think productively using its chain of thought in a highly data-efficient training process. We have found that the performance of o1 consistently improves with more reinforcement learning (train-time compute) and with more time spent thinking (test-time compute). The constraints on scaling this approach differ substantially from those of LLM pretraining, and we are continuing to investigate them.

![The image shows two scatter plots comparing "o1 AIME accuracy" during training and at test time. Both charts have "pass@1 accuracy" on the y-axis and compute (log scale) on the x-axis. The dots indicate increasing accuracy with more compute time.](images/learning-to-reason-with-llms-openai/img_001.png)

o1 performance smoothly improves with both train-time and test-time compute

## Evals

To highlight the reasoning improvement over GPT‑4o, we tested our models on a diverse set of human exams and ML benchmarks. We show that o1 significantly outperforms GPT‑4o on the vast majority of these reasoning-heavy tasks. Unless otherwise specified, we evaluated o1 on the maximal test-time compute setting.

o1 greatly improves over GPT-4o on challenging reasoning benchmarks. Solid bars show pass@1 accuracy and the shaded region shows the performance of majority vote (consensus) with 64 samples.

o1 improves over GPT-4o on a wide range of benchmarks, including 54/57 MMLU subcategories. Seven are shown for illustration.

o1 improves over GPT-4o on a wide range of benchmarks, including 54/57 MMLU subcategories. Seven are shown for illustration.

In many reasoning-heavy benchmarks, o1 rivals the performance of human experts. Recent frontier models[1](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/#citation-bottom-1) do so well on MATH[2](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/#citation-bottom-2)and GSM8K that these benchmarks are no longer effective at differentiating models. We evaluated math performance on AIME, an exam designed to challenge the brightest high school math students in America. On the 2024 AIME exams, GPT‑4o only solved on average 12% (1.8/15) of problems. o1 averaged 74% (11.1/15) with a single sample per problem, 83% (12.5/15) with consensus among 64 samples, and 93% (13.9/15) when re-ranking 1000 samples with a learned scoring function. A score of 13.9 places it among the top 500 students nationally and above the cutoff for the USA Mathematical Olympiad.

We also evaluated o1 on GPQA diamond, a difficult intelligence benchmark which tests for expertise in chemistry, physics and biology. In order to compare models to humans, we recruited experts with PhDs to answer GPQA-diamond questions. We found that o1 surpassed the performance of those human experts, becoming the first model to do so on this benchmark. These results do not imply that o1 is more capable than a PhD in all respects — only that the model is more proficient in solving some problems that a PhD would be expected to solve. On several other ML benchmarks, o1 improved over the state-of-the-art. With its vision perception capabilities enabled, o1 scored 78.2% on MMMU, making it the first model to be competitive with human experts. It also outperformed GPT‑4o on 54 out of 57 MMLU subcategories.

## Chain of Thought

Similar to how a human may think for a long time before responding to a difficult question, o1 uses a chain of thought when attempting to solve a problem. Through reinforcement learning, o1 learns to hone its chain of thought and refine the strategies it uses. It learns to recognize and correct its mistakes. It learns to break down tricky steps into simpler ones. It learns to try a different approach when the current one isn’t working. This process dramatically improves the model’s ability to reason. To illustrate this leap forward, we showcase the chain of thought from o1‑preview on several difficult problems below.

## GPT-4o

oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx -> Think step by step

Use the example above to decode:

oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz

Let’s break this down step by step based on the example:

**1\. Example given:**• Input: oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx

• Output: **Think step by step**

By examining the words:

• The pattern involves selecting specific letters or transforming them.

**2\. Now, let’s decode the new phrase:**• Input: oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz

**Step-by-step decoding process:**

**Identify possible word divisions.**

The first phrase might follow the same structure as the example. It seems like the input text could be broken into groups based on natural separations or patterns.

A possible division could be:

- oyekaijzdf
- aaptcg
- suaokybhai
- ouow
- aqht
- mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz

However, to make a meaningful decoding, I would need more context about the transformations or letter shifting that might be involved.

Could you provide any additional decoding rules or transformations used in this cipher?

oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx -> Think step by step

Use the example above to decode:

oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz

Thought for 5 seconds

First, what is going on here?

We are given:

First, an example:

"oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx -> Think step by step"

We can see that when "oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx" is transformed to "Think step by step"

Our task is: Use the example above to decode: "oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz"

So the first part is to figure out how "oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx" is decoded into "Think step by step"

Observation 1: The phrase "Think step by step" is 18 letters (excluding spaces) . Let's count the letters.

Similarly, let's count the letters in "oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx"

Original Ciphertext:

oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx

Plaintext:

Think step by step

First, break down the letters:

Ciphertext letters: o y f j d n i s d r r t q w a i n r a c x z m y n z b h h x

Total letters: Let's count the letters in the ciphertext.

First word: oyfjdnisdr (10 letters)

Second word: rtqwainr (8 letters)

Third word: acxz (4 letters)

Fourth word: mynzbhhx (8 letters)

Total letters in ciphertext: 10 + 8 + 4 + 8 = 30 letters

Plaintext: Think step by step

First word: Think (5 letters)

Second word: step (4 letters)

Third word: by (2 letters)

Fourth word: step (4 letters)

Total letters in plaintext: 5 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 15 letters

Hmm.

But actually in the problem it says the example:

\[Ciphertext\] -> Think step by step

So is the decoding process that the ciphertext maps to "Think step by step"?

Our goal is to use the example above to decode:

"oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz"

First, the cipher seems connected to the plaintext.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the easiest way is to try to see patterns.

Option 1: Try to find mapping from letters to letters.

Do any letters match?

First, let's write down the ciphertext and plaintext letters on top of each other.

Ciphertext: o y f j d n i s d r r t q w a i n r a c x z m y n z b h h x

Plaintext: T h i n k s t e p b y s t e p

Wait a minute.

I think maybe there is an anagram or substitution cipher here.

Alternatively, I think that we can notice that each group of ciphertext corresponds to a plaintext word.

Check the number of letters.

First ciphertext word: oyfjdnisdr (10 letters)

First plaintext word: Think (5 letters)

Hmm.

Second ciphertext word: rtqwainr (8 letters)

Second plaintext word: step (4 letters)

Third ciphertext word: acxz (4 letters)

Third plaintext word: by (2 letters)

Fourth ciphertext word: mynzbhhx (8 letters)

Fourth plaintext word: step (4 letters)

Interesting.

It seems that the ciphertext words are exactly twice as long as the plaintext words.

(10 vs 5, 8 vs 4, 4 vs 2, 8 vs 4)

Idea: Maybe we need to take every other letter or rebuild the plaintext from the ciphertext accordingly.

Let's test this theory.

If we take every other letter from the ciphertext words, maybe we'll get the plaintext.

Let's try this for the first word:

Ciphertext word: o y f j d n i s d r (10 letters)

Alternate letters:

First letters (positions 1,3,5,7,9): o f d i d

Second letters (positions 2,4,6,8,10): y j n s r

Wait: Let's try taking every second letter or first letter.

Option 1: Take the odd positions:

Positions: 1 3 5 7 9

Letters: o f d i d

Plaintext word is "Think", letters are T h i n k

Hmm.

Perhaps we can map letters:

o f d i d --> Think

Not directly

Option 2: Try mapping as per an assigned code: perhaps columns of letters?

Alternatively, perhaps the cipher is more complex.

Alternatively, notice that "oyfjdnisdr" has 10 letters and "Think" has 5 letters.

What if each plaintext letter is being represented by two ciphertext letters?

Similarly for other words.

Suppose that each plaintext letter corresponds to pair of letters in the ciphertext.

Meaning that the first two letters of ciphertext map to the first plaintext letter, and so on.

So for the first word, partition the ciphertext letters into pairs:

oy fj dn is dr

Corresponding to plaintext letters T h i n k

So we can attempt to map:

oy -> T

fj -> h

dn -> i

is -> n

dr -> k

If this is the mapping, perhaps each pair of letters maps to one plaintext letter.

Similarly for other words.

Let's test this mapping.

Is there a consistent mapping from pairs to letters?

Let's make a table of pairs and corresponding letters.

First, make the pairs from the first word and their corresponding plaintext letters:

Ciphertext Pairs -> Plaintext Letter

oy -> T

fj -> h

dn -> i

is -> n

dr -> k

Now, what's the mapping from "oy" to 'T'?

Is there a way to map 'oy' to 'T'?

Similarly for others.

One possible way is that 'oy' represents 'T'.

But how?

Option 1: Sum of the letters.

Convert letters to numbers (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26)

So let's try to get to 'T' from 'o' and 'y'

o = 15

y = 25

Sum: 15 +25 = 40

But 'T' is 20.

Alternatively, perhaps subtract: 25 -15 = 10.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps combine the numbers in some way.

Alternatively, think about their positions in the alphabet.

Alternatively, perhaps the letters are encrypted via a code.

Alternatively, perhaps if we overlay the word 'Think' over the cipher pairs 'oy', 'fj', etc., the cipher is formed by substituting each plaintext letter with two letters.

Alternatively, perhaps consider the 'original' letters.

Let's look at the letters between the word "Think" and "oyfjdnisdr"

Perhaps we can spot that "oyfjdnisdr" is an anagram for "Thinkfiles"?

But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, think of the pairs.

Suppose we assign numbers to letters: a=1, b=2, ..., z=26

Consider the numbers in 'oy':

o = 15

y = 25

Add them: 15 + 25 = 40

Now, for 'T' we have:

'T' is number 20

What if we take the sum of the cipher pair mod 26.

15 +25 = 40

Then 40 mod 26 = 14

14 corresponds to 'N'

Doesn't match.

Alternatively, see if the cipher pairs correspond to something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the pair 'oy' corresponds to 'T' via key.

Alternatively, perhaps it's as simple as 'oy' is 'T'.

But 'o' corresponds to 'T', subtracting 'o' ASCII code from 'T'.

Now, let's think in terms of symmetric letters.

Alternatively, perhaps we can spot that the letters correspond to the first letters of words.

But perhaps an easier way is to look at the word positions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can see that the ciphertext letters are offsets from the plaintext letters.

So let's try to map the pairs to the plaintext letters.

First pair 'oy' and plaintext letter 'T'

Letter 'o' is 15, 'T' is 20

Letter 'o' + 5 = 'T' (15 +5=20)

But 'y' is 25, which is 5 letters after 'T' (20 +5=25)

Interesting, seems that 'o' +5 = 'T'

Similarly, 'y' +1 = 'Z', which is not 'T'.

Alternatively, maybe the average of the two letters corresponds to 'T'

(15 +25)/2 =20, which is 'T'

Wait a minute, that seems promising.

First pair: 'o' (15) + 'y' (25) = 40

40 /2 =20

20 corresponds to 'T'

So perhaps the average of the letters in the pair corresponds to the plaintext letter.

Let's check this with the second pair.

Second pair: 'fj' corresponding to 'h'

Letters 'f'=6, 'j'=10

Sum: 6+10=16

Average:16/2=8

8 corresponds to 'h' (since 'h' is 8)

Success!

Third pair: 'dn' to 'i'

'd'=4, 'n'=14

Sum:4+14=18

Average:18/2=9

9 corresponds to 'i'(9='i')

But 'i' is 9, so that seems off by 1.

So perhaps we need to think carefully about letters.

Wait, 18/2=9, 9 corresponds to 'I'

So this works.

Fourth pair: 'is' corresponding to 'n'

'i'=9, 's'=19

Sum:9+19=28

Average:28/2=14

14 corresponds to 'n'(14='N')

Yes!

Fifth pair: 'dr' corresponds to 'k'

'd'=4, 'r'=18

Sum:4+18=22

Average:22/2=11

11 corresponds to 'k'(11='K')

Perfect!

So our code is: For each pair, sum their numeric values, divide by 2, get the corresponding letter.

Alternatively, the average of the numeric values of the letters corresponds to the plaintext letter.

This seems to be a valid method.

Now let's test this with the other words.

Second word ciphertext: rtqwainr

Ciphertext pairs:

rt -> s

qw -> ?

ai -> ?

nr -> ?

Corresponding to plaintext letters 's', 't', 'e', 'p'

So let's take the pairs:

1\. 'rt' corresponds to 's'

r=18, t=20

Sum:38

Average:19

19 corresponds to 's' (19='S')

Good

2\. 'qw' corresponds to 't'

q=17, w=23

Sum:17+23=40

Average:20

20 corresponds to 't' (20='T')

Good

3\. 'ai' corresponds to 'e'

a=1, i=9

Sum:10

Average:5

5 corresponds to 'e' (5='E')

Good

4\. 'nr' corresponds to 'p'

n=14, r=18

Sum:32

Average:16

16 corresponds to 'p' (16='P')

Perfect!

Third word: acxz (4 letters)

Plaintext word: 'by' (2 letters)

Ciphertext pairs:

a c

x z

Plaintext letters: 'b', 'y'

First pair: 'a', 'c'

a=1, c=3

Sum:4

Average:2

2 corresponds to 'b'(2='B')

Second pair: 'x' and 'z'

x=24, z=26

Sum:50

Average:25

25 corresponds to 'y'(25='Y')

Yes!

Fourth word: mynzbhhx (8 letters)

Plaintext word: 'step' (4 letters)

Ciphertext pairs:

my

nz

bh

hx

Plaintext letters 's','t','e','p'

First pair 'm','y'

m=13, y=25

Sum:38

Average:19

19 corresponds to 's'(19='S')

Second pair: 'n','z'

n=14, z=26

Sum: 40

Average:20

20='t'

Third pair: 'b','h'

b=2, h=8

Sum:10

Average:5

5='e'

Fourth pair: 'h','x'

h=8, x=24

Sum:32

Average:16

16='p'

Got it!

Now, given this, we can decode the given message.

Ciphertext to decode:

"oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz"

First, we need to divide into words.

Given that the ciphertext in the example had words of length:

-10 letters (5 pairs)

-8 letters (4 pairs)

-4 letters (2 pairs)

-8 letters (4 pairs)

Transported to plaintext words of:

-5 letters

-4 letters

-2 letters

-4 letters

So perhaps in our supplied ciphertext, we need to divide the letters into words accordingly.

Ciphertext: o y e k a i j z d f a a p t c g s u a o k y b h a i o u o w a q h t m y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z

First, let's write the letters in order:

1) oyekaijzdf (10 letters) -> word of 5 letters

2) aaptcg (6 letters) -> word of 3 letters

3) suaokybhai (10 letters) -> word of 5 letters

4) ouow (4 letters) -> word of 2 letters

5) aqht (4 letters) -> word of 2 letters

6) mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz (22 letters) -> word of 11 letters

Totals:

So the letters are:

First word: oyekaijzdf (10 letters = 5 pairs)

Second word: aaptcg (6 letters=3 pairs)

Third word: suaokybhai (10 letters=5 pairs)

Fourth word: ouow (4 letters=2 pairs)

Fifth word: aqht (4 letters=2 pairs)

Sixth word: mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz (22 letters=11 pairs)

So we can suppose that the plaintext words have lengths:

1) 5 letters

2) 3 letters

3) 5 letters

4) 2 letters

5) 2 letters

6)11 letters

Now we can proceed to decode.

First word: oyekaijzdf

Divide into pairs:

oy

ek

ai

jz

df

So we can find the plaintext letters by averaging the numeric values of the letters in each pair.

First pair: 'o','y'

o=15, y=25

Sum=40

Average=20

20='T'

Second pair: 'e','k'

e=5, k=11

Sum=16

Average=8

8='H'

Third pair: 'a','i'

a=1, i=9

Sum=10

Average=5

5='E'

Fourth pair: 'j','z'

j=10, z=26

Sum=36

Average=18

18='R'

Fifth pair: 'd','f'

d=4, f=6

Sum=10

Average=5

5='E'

So the first word is 'T','H','E','R','E'

So 'THERE'

Second word: aaptcg

Pairs:

aa

pt

cg

First pair: 'a','a'

a=1, a=1

Sum=2

Average=1

1='A'

Second pair: 'p','t'

p=16, t=20

Sum=36

Average=18

18='R'

Third pair: 'c','g'

c=3, g=7

Sum=10

Average=5

5='E'

So second word: 'A','R','E'

Third word: suaokybhai

Pairs:

su

ao

ky

bh

ai

First pair: s=19, u=21

Sum=40, Average=20

20='T'

Second pair: a=1, o=15

Sum=16, Average=8

8='H'

Third pair: k=11, y=25

Sum=36, Average=18

18='R'

Fourth pair: b=2, h=8

Sum=10, Average=5

5='E'

Fifth pair: a=1, i=9

Sum=10, Average=5

5='E'

Third word: 'T','H','R','E','E'

Fourth word: ouow

Pairs: ou, ow

First pair: o=15, u=21

Sum=36, Average=18

18='R'

Second pair: o=15, w=23

Sum=38, Average=19

19='S'

Fourth word: 'R','S'

Fifth word: aqht

Pairs: a q, h t

First pair: a=1, q=17

Sum=18, Average=9

9='I'

Second pair: h=8, t=20

Sum=28, Average=14

14='N'

Fifth word: 'I','N'

Sixth word: mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz (22 letters: 11 pairs)

Pairs:

m y

n z

n v

a a

t z

a c

d f

o u

l x

x z

Let's list them properly.

Wait, earlier I missed some letters there.

Let's re-express the sixth word letters:

m y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z

Total letters: 22 letters

Pairs:

1\. m y

2\. n z

3\. n v

4\. a a

5\. t z

6\. a c

7\. d f

8\. o u

9\. l x

10\. x x

11\. z

Wait, that's 21 letters.

But in total, we have 22 letters; I think I have a mismatch.

Wait, in the problem the sixth word is:

mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz

Let's separate the letters:

m y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z

Total letters: 22 letters

So pairs would be:

1\. m y

2\. n z

3\. n v

4\. a a

5\. t z

6\. a c

7\. d f

8\. o u

9\. l x

10\. x x

11\. z

Wait, 'z' is only one letter at the end.

So maybe the letters are:

1\. m y

2\. n z

3\. n v

4\. a a

5\. t z

6\. a c

7\. d f

8\. o u

9\. l x

10\. x x

11\. z (left alone?)

But then we're missing a letter.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'z' at the end is an extra letter or it's paired with the previous 'x'.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps when we reach the last 'x x z', we should write:

9\. l x

10\. x z

Total pairs: 11

So updated pairs:

1\. m y

2\. n z

3\. n v

4\. a a

5\. t z

6\. a c

7\. d f

8\. o u

9\. l x

10\. x z

Now total pairs: 10 pairs. But we are supposed to have 11 letters in the plaintext word.

So perhaps I have miscounted and not considered including 'f' or 'z'.

Wait, is there any chance that the sequence is:

1\. m y

2\. n z

3\. n v

4\. a a

5\. t z

6\. a c

7\. d f

8\. o u

9\. l x

10\. x x

11\. z

We have 22 letters.

Perhaps the 'x x' and 'z' are overlapping.

But we need 11 pairs.

I think for this to work, we need to create 11 pairs from the 22 letters.

So let's try pairing letters in order, taking two letters at a time.

1\. m y

2\. n z

3\. n v

4\. a a

5\. t z

6\. a c

7\. d f

8\. o u

9\. l x

10\. x x

11\. z ?

But again, last pair only has one letter 'z'

Alternatively, we might need to adjust the pairs.

Perhaps it's 'ou', 'lx', 'xz', and there is no extra 'x'.

Maybe I miswrote.

Wait, let's write the letters as they come:

m y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z

Positions:

1 m

2 y

3 n

4 z

5 n

6 v

7 a

8 a

9 t

10 z

11 a

12 c

13 d

14 f

15 o

16 u

17 l

18 x

19 x

20 z

So 20 letters.

Now that makes sense.

Now we can divide into pairs:

Pairs:

1\. m y

2\. n z

3\. n v

4\. a a

5\. t z

6\. a c

7\. d f

8\. o u

9\. l x

10\. x z

Total of 10 pairs, which will correspond to 10 letters.

But earlier we thought the word was 11 letters.

But 10 letters may be acceptable.

Maybe we should proceed with the 10 pairs.

First pair: m y

m=13, y=25

Sum=38

Average=19

19='S'

Second pair: n z

n=14, z=26

Sum=40

Average=20

20='T'

Third pair: n v

n=14, v=22

Sum=36

Average=18

18='R'

Fourth pair: a a

a=1, a=1

Sum=2

Average=1

1='A'

Fifth pair: t z

t=20, z=26

Sum=46

Average=23

23='W'

Sixth pair: a c

a=1, c=3

Sum=4

Average=2

2='B'

Seventh pair: d f

d=4, f=6

Sum=10

Average=5

5='E'

Eighth pair: o u

o=15, u=21

Sum=36

Average=18

18='R'

Ninth pair: l x

l=12, x=24

Sum=36

Average=18

18='R'

Tenth pair: x z

x=24, z=26

Sum=50

Average=25

25='Y'

So the tenth word is 'S', 'T', 'R', 'A', 'W', 'B', 'E', 'R', 'R', 'Y'

Wait that's 10 letters

So the sixth word is 'STRAWBERRY', which makes sense.

So putting all these translated letters together:

First word: 'THERE'

Second word: 'ARE'

Third word: 'THREE'

Fourth word: 'RS' (? Doesn't make sense)

Wait, the fourth word, the pairs were:

ou ow

Pairs:

First pair: o u

o=15, u=21

Sum=36, Average=18

18='R'

Second pair: o w

o=15, w=23

Sum=38, Average=19

19='S'

So we get 'R','S'

Similarly, fifth word 'IN'

'R', 'S' 'I','N'

So the message so far is

'THERE ARE THREE RS IN'

And then 'STRAWBERRY'

Wait, let's put the words together:

'THERE ARE THREE Rs IN STRAWBERRY'

I think 'RS' is 'R's', meaning 'Rs'

So the message is:

'THERE ARE THREE R'S IN STRAWBERRY'

Which is true.

So the decoded message is:

"THERE ARE THREE R'S IN STRAWBERRY"

## Coding

We trained a model that scored 213 points and ranked in the 49th percentile in the 2024 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI), by initializing from o1 and training to further improve programming skills. This model competed in the 2024 IOI under the same conditions as the human contestants. It had ten hours to solve six challenging algorithmic problems and was allowed 50 submissions per problem.

For each problem, our system sampled many candidate submissions and submitted 50 of them based on a test-time selection strategy. Submissions were selected based on performance on the IOI public test cases, model-generated test cases, and a learned scoring function. If we had instead submitted at random, we would have only scored 156 points on average, suggesting that this strategy was worth nearly 60 points under competition constraints.

With a relaxed submission constraint, we found that model performance improved significantly. When allowed 10,000 submissions per problem, the model achieved a score of 362.14 – above the gold medal threshold – even without any test-time selection strategy.

Finally, we simulated competitive programming contests hosted by Codeforces to demonstrate this model’s coding skill. Our evaluations closely matched competition rules and allowed for 10 submissions. GPT‑4o achieved an Elo rating[3](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/#citation-bottom-3)of 808, which is in the 11th percentile of human competitors. This model far exceeded both GPT‑4o and o1—it achieved an Elo rating of 1807, performing better than 93% of competitors.

![The image shows a bar chart comparing Codeforces Elo percentile rankings for different models. GPT-4o has 808 Elo (11th percentile), o1 preview has 1258 Elo (62nd percentile), o1 has 1673 Elo (89th percentile), and o1-ioi has 1807 Elo (93rd percentile).](images/learning-to-reason-with-llms-openai/img_016.png)

Further fine-tuning on programming competitions improves o1. The improved model ranked in the 49th percentile in the 2024 International Olympiad in Informatics under competition rules.

## Human preference evaluation

In addition to exams and academic benchmarks, we also evaluated human preference of o1‑preview vs GPT‑4o on challenging, open-ended prompts in a broad spectrum of domains. In this evaluation, human trainers were shown anonymized responses to a prompt from o1‑preview and GPT‑4o, and voted for which response they preferred. o1‑preview is preferred to gpt-4o by a large margin in reasoning-heavy categories like data analysis, coding, and math. However, o1‑preview is not preferred on some natural language tasks, suggesting that it is not well-suited for all use cases.

## Safety

Chain of thought reasoning provides new opportunities for alignment and safety. We found that integrating our policies for model behavior into the chain of thought of a reasoning model is an effective way to robustly teach human values and principles. By teaching the model our safety rules and how to reason about them in context, we found evidence of reasoning capability directly benefiting model robustness: o1‑preview achieved substantially improved performance on key jailbreak evaluations and our hardest internal benchmarks for evaluating our model's safety refusal boundaries. We believe that using a chain of thought offers significant advances for safety and alignment because (1) it enables us to observe the model thinking in a legible way, and (2) the model reasoning about safety rules is more robust to out-of-distribution scenarios.

To stress-test our improvements, we conducted a suite of safety tests and red-teaming before deployment, in accordance with our [Preparedness Framework⁠(opens in a new window)](https://cdn.openai.com/openai-preparedness-framework-beta.pdf). We found that chain of thought reasoning contributed to capability improvements across our evaluations. Of particular note, we observed [interesting instances of reward hacking⁠(opens in a new window)](https://cdn.openai.com/o1-system-card.pdf#page=16). Detailed results from these evaluations can be found in the accompanying [System Card](https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-system-card/).

## Hiding the Chains of Thought

We believe that a hidden chain of thought presents a unique opportunity for monitoring models. Assuming it is faithful and legible, the hidden chain of thought allows us to "read the mind" of the modeland understand its thought process. For example, in the future we may wish to monitor the chain of thought for signs of manipulating the user. However, for this to work the model must have freedom to express its thoughts in unaltered form, so we cannot train any policy compliance or user preferences onto the chain of thought. We also do not want to make an unaligned chain of thought directly visible to users.

Therefore, after weighing multiple factors including user experience, competitive advantage, and the option to pursue the chain of thought monitoring, we have decided not to show the raw chains of thought to users. We acknowledge this decision has disadvantages. We strive to partially make up for it by teaching the model to reproduce any useful ideas from the chain of thought in the answer. For the o1 model series we show a model-generated summary of the chain of thought.

## Conclusion

o1 significantly advances the state-of-the-art in AI reasoning. We plan to release improved versions of this model as we continue iterating. We expect these new reasoning capabilities will improve our ability to align models to human values and principles. We believe o1 – and its successors – will unlock many new use cases for AI in science, coding, math, and related fields. We are excited for users and API developers to discover how it can improve their daily work.
